# WikiPusher
Demonstrate WikiExperiment working in action.

# Setup
Get a PAT token that can push. It can be scoped as long as it includes the wiki repo. e.g to push to Foo/Bar wiki you need a scoped PAT for Foo/Bar with Contents permission.

# Page creation
Just create any files that end with .md and Github Wiki will pick it up, no matter how many folders are there.
